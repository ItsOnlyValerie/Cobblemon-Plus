# Cobblemon: Sanctuary
Minecraft modpack for Cobblemon Plus! Currently under development.

Before anything, I want to include that some mods within the modpack will be removed once Cobblemon gets updated to include those features. 
The list of mods I will remove once the update is out are:

https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon-fight-them-all
https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon-ride-on
https://modrinth.com/mod/rad-gyms
https://modrinth.com/mod/rctmod
https://modrinth.com/mod/rctapi
You can see Cobblemon's roadmap on their public Trello page:
